In 2022, SimpleLogin and Proton (known for [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) and [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/)) joined forces to work towards a vision where people can easily protect their online identities and privacy. 

While we’ve maintained SimpleLogin services independently from Proton, we’ve benefited from additional infrastructure Proton provided and passed a [security audit from Securitum](https://simplelogin.io/blog/security-audit/) with no critical issues or vulnerabilities discovered.

We also worked with Proton to develop [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass), an open-source password manager designed for productivity and ease of use. As a product developed by the same SimpleLogin team, Proton Pass offers email aliases out of the box for free.

Given Proton Pass’s growth and its overlap with SimpleLogin’s features and community, we felt it would make sense to combine the Proton Pass Plus plan and the SimpleLogin Premium plan. This blog post explains what we’re changing and how it will affect our prices.

## Bringing together SimpleLogin and Proton Pass

Until now, you had to maintain separate Proton Pass and SimpleLogin subscriptions to access each tool’s premium features. This isn’t an ideal experience, and given the similarity between Proton Pass and SimpleLogin, we’re centralizing the services of each product into one subscription. 

**From now on, anyone with a SimpleLogin Premium plan will have access to the premium features available with a Pass Plus plan subscription.** This includes:

* Convenient password autofill, autosave, and autosuggest
* [Vault sharing and secure link sharing](https://proton.me/pass/password-sharing) for improved collaboration 
* Built-in 2FA authenticator to streamline logging in
* [Dark Web Monitoring](https://proton.me/pass/pass-monitor) that constantly checks for data breaches

If you’re an existing SimpleLogin user, the price of your subscription will stay the same: you’ll still pay $30 annually.

For new users, the price for the SimpleLogin annual subscription is increasing from $2.50/month (or $36/year) to $2.99/month (or $35.88/year), starting today.


## Proton Pass

Proton Pass is available on all platforms. With a free account, you can use Proton Pass to store unlimited logins and sync between all of your devices for free. With a paid account, you can go beyond password protection with [vault and secure link sharing](https://proton.me/pass/password-sharing), [Dark Web Monitoring](https://proton.me/pass/pass-monitor), a [built-in two-factor authenticator](https://proton.me/support/pass-2fa) and [unlimited email aliases](https://proton.me/pass/aliases) backed by SimpleLogin.

Like SimpleLogin, Proton Pass is entirely financed by our community. We don’t rely on venture capital to fund our products, and as a result we are entirely independent. This allows us to focus on serving the people who use Proton Pass instead of shareholders.

## How to start using Proton Pass 

If you already have a Proton Pass Account, you can link it to SimpleLogin from your [SimpleLogin dashboard](https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/setting). 

If you’re not using Proton Pass yet, [create a free account](https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?ref=psshero&currency=USD&plan=free) with the same email address you use on SimpleLogin. Using the same email address as your SimpleLogin one will make the email aliases sync work out of the box - otherwise you can also link your SimpleLogin account to the Proton Pass one on [SimpleLogin dashboard](https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/setting).

If you’re using a free SimpleLogin account, we’d still recommend using Proton Pass. It’s an effective tool for maintaining your digital privacy and making life easier with password autofill. Proton Pass can help you update weak or reused passwords as you browse the internet, and securely share information with anyone.
